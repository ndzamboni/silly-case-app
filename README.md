# SillyCase Converter

SillyCase Converter is a fun, interactive web app that converts a user-input sentence into "sillycase," where each letter alternates between uppercase and lowercase. The app provides a real-time conversion, a copy-to-clipboard button, and stylish feedback that the text has been copied.
